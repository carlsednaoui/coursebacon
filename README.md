# To do

## Round 1

curriculum has many resources
a resource can belong to a curriculum

## Round 2

Get rid of "BookReview, CourseReview, etc" and instead have "Comments" with a resource ID

Add tags that autocomplete (for resources)

Add a way to "thumb up" or "tumb down" resources or curriculums

Add a way to "add to favorite (or add to learning list)"

Allow for anonymous submission

Resource score = Backlinks (need to update nightly - google, seomoz), Tweets (nightly), tumbs, 

Add curriculums (which are a collection of Resources) - dont show full curriculum unless user is signed in

## Other

1. add search functionality
2. allow users to modify item descriptions (like a wiki)
3. allow the star to sort by most popular
4. find a way to have popular#{page} instead of popular_course, popular_book, popular_tutorial - Basically, I need to create a "popularity" function

> def popularity(item)
> --
> ---
> --
> end
